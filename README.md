The goal of the SCION-Pathdiscovery project is to leverage the path-awareness features of the SCION secure Internet architecture in order to discover a fast and reliable content lookup and delivery. The challenge is to search suitable paths considering the respective performance requirements, and combine different candidates into a multi-path connection. To this end, we aim to design and implement optimal path selection and data placement strategies for a decentralized content storage and delivery system.

The primary result is a library that can be used by developers to discover a set of optimised paths across a SCION network. This will first be tested with multiple, high performance paths to a single peer, and subsequently be expanded to larger topologies. As a further demonstration and stress test of these capabilities, the project will implement a real-world use case: BitTorrent over SCION. This should give a good impression of the ability to improve lookup speed and optimise download performance by evaluating and aggregating multiple paths to short lived peers typical to the use pattern of Bittorrent.

Peers are to be identified by a combination of their address and the path used to transfer packets to them, called path-level peers. This approach allows BitTorrentâ€™s sophisticated file sharing mechanisms to run on path level, instead of implementing a dedicated multipath connection to each peer.

## Task 1. Optimal Path Selection for Efficient Multipath Usage
This task consists of creating a detailed [concept](doc/path-selection.org) as well as planning the implementation of a high performance library providing optimal [path selection](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/netsys-lab/scion-path-discovery/pathselection) for efficient [multipath usage](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/netsys-lab/scion-path-discovery/api) over [SCION](https://www.scion-architecture.net) capable of dealing with the high requirements of BitTorrent

## Task 5. A partially disjoint path selection algorithm

We propose to enhance our SCION multipath library with a partially disjoint path selection algorithm, that will significantly increase the application performance by gradually re-distributing application traffic over alternative paths, while monitoring overall throughput.

### Milestone(s)
- [ ] In our SCION Pathdiscovery project funded by NGI Zero Discovery, we have developed robust concepts for disjoint path selection as a means to avoid shared bottlenecks. We achieve bottleneck avoidance in uploading peers through only using completely disjoint paths. However, also partially disjoint paths may lead to performance improvements, which was not considered yet. We thus propose to extend our core path selection strategy as follows: 
  - Peers perform "path exploration" by shifting portions of their traffic to alternative paths while monitoring overall throughput, gradually re-distributing traffic to maximize network utilization. 
  - We expect the proposed extensions to significantly increase the performance of our SCION multipath library by leveraging unused network capacities. 
  - Finally, we anticipate that our refined path selection approach contributes significant additional insights in the field of path-aware networking. 
  - Consequently, we plan to implement and evaluate the proposed path selection algorithm in the next step, in combination with revisiting our multipath library API and performing bug fixes.
